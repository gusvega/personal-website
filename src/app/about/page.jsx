        <p>
          Hello There!  My name is Gus Vega. I am a Machine Learning Engineer.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Let's break down my life into three parts...
        </p>

            Personal
          </p>
          <p>
            I was born in Mexico and raised there until I was 16 years old. Then my family and I moved to Texas. Lived a very humble life in Mexico - reason to move to Texas. Went to high school then college. I met my beautiful wife while in college and now have been happily married for 10 years. No kids yet. My wife is my engine, she is my everything. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            We love outdoor activities - my favorite is going paddle boarding. We go camping every time there is a chance. I enjoy cooking for my wife while camping... I am trying to master cooking carne asada. I have two dogs (Bella and Kelso). Bella is a terrier mix and probably weights around 15 pounds. We rescued Bella when she was 2 years old. She is now 9 years. She is super loving and loves her own space. Kelso is a poodle and saint bernard mix. He is 2 years old. Kelso is super active and loves the water. They both love riding with us in our Jeep. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            There is three things that I love doing and probably wont stop doing them any time soon. Traveling, playing indoor soccer, and making music. I find joy traveling and experiencing new cultures around the world. Soccer has been one of my passions since the day I was born probably. If I was not in tech, I would probably be a music producer and DJ (techno music baby!).

            Education
          </p>
          <p>
            My education journey has not been the most exciting one. I went to high school right after I moved to the US. Pretty exciting time in high school since I was pretty involved in sports. But never cared about school. Had to learn English because I knew not a single word... I learned a couple words in English by the time I graduated from high school. Even though I did not care much about school, I decided I wanted to go to college and get a bachelors in something to make my parents proud.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I went to college blind. I knew nothing about what college really was or what it involved. I was the first one to graduate high school in my family and the first one to go to college. So not a lot of guidance. Had an amazing time in college (I miss the parties). Somehow I managed to graduate college with a bachelors in computer information systems.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Once I graduated college, I realized that I hated what I studied. Decided to become a software engineer instead. I taught myself how to code. Built mobile apps and websites. Fell in love with building websites and went a lot deeper into learning the ins and outs of building production level web applications. and now, building web application is my focus and what I truly love doing. Oh along the way, I found automation fascinating so decided to focus on that too. Now, I find myself always learning something related to my field.

            Professional
          </p>
          <p>
            Work life started pretty young for me. Probably at the age of 10 in Mexico, my brother and I would help my dad collect recyclable materials from stores around the city (like tons of material), so we could then sell to recycling companies $$. It was kind of like a side hustle for my dad... but no really because we saw that the necessity drove him to it. Learned the importance of work from a young age. At the age of 12, i'd say, I got my first actual 'job'. I worked at a local grocery store where I would help the owners sell fresh orange juice to the nearby office workers. I was finally making some money :)
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            The move to the US came, since the town where we lived when we moved here was super small (1000 people), there was not a lot of options for me to choose from when it comes to work. There were only cow feed yards, pig farms, and crop growing fields. I worked in cow feed yards in the weekends through high school and some college. While in college, I knew it was time to try something different. Started at Lowe's as a cart pusher, then dish washer at a restaurant, then cook, and then as a server. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Luckily, I had good friends and one of them told me about an internship at the electricity company that he worked at as network and systems analyst. I guess the manager liked me and gave me the internship. That job is where I learned one or two things about computer networking and linux. When I graduated college, I made the critical decision to shift my focus into software engineering and decided that moving to Denver, CO was a good choice.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            My decision to move to Denver was the correct one, even though I struggled at the beginning, everything came to place. I got my first job right out of college as a DevOps Engineer (place where I felt in love with software automation). Then Raytheon technologies where I had the opportunity to work in the front end and back end of applications being developed. General Electric reached out and decided to make the move. In GE, I learned everything about deployments, infrastructure, security, etc. Microsoft reached out and seemed to like what I had done and so I decided to make the move and moved to Seattle WA.
